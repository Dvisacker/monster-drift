# monster-drift

üìªüèé Drive a radio controlled car with Node.js and HackRF. This module
should work with most radio controlled cars operating on a frequency of
27MHz.

## Installation

```
npm install monster-drift --save
```

## Usage

Drive forward for one seconds and stop:

```js
var drive = require('monster-drift')()

drive.forward()

setTimeout(function () {
  drive.stop()
}, 1000)
```

## API

### `var drive = new MonsterDrift([options])`

This module exposes a `MonsterDrift` object that you can initiate to get
a `drive` object.

Options:

- `stop` - Milliseconds in which to automatically stop the card if no
  drive commands have been issued (default: never)
- `freq` - The frequency in Hz (default: 27MHz)
- `id` - The HackRF device id to use (default: `0`)
- `gain` - The HackRF TX gain (default: `40`)

### `drive.forward()`

Drive forward.

### `drive.backward()`

Drive backward.

### `drive.left()`

Turn wheels left.

### `drive.right()`

Turn wheels right.

### `drive.forwardRight()`

Drive forward and right.

### `drive.forwardLeft()`

Drive forward and left.

### `drive.backwardRight()`

Drive backward and turn right.

### `drive.backwardLeft()`

Drive backward and turn left.

### `drive.stop([callback])`

Stop the car and turn off transmitter. Calls optional `callback` when
done.

### `drive.close([callback])`

Stop the car, turn off transmitter and close the HackRF USB connection.
Calls optional `callback` when done.

### `drive.turn180([callback])`

Make a 180. Calls `callback` when done.

### `drive.batch(commands[, callback])`

Issue a series of driving commands to the car and call optional
`callback` when done.

The `commands` argument is an array of commands. Each command is a
double tuple with the following format: `[function, duration]`. The
`function` part is a drive function, e.g. `drive.forward`, and the
`duration` part is the number of milliseconds to perform the operation.

If the last tuple contains a `duration` then `drive.stop` will be called
automatically. Leave out `duratuon` to continue forever.

```js
// make a 180
drive.batch([
  [drive.forward, 1000],
  [drive.right, 125],
  [drive.backwardLeft, 100],
  [drive.backward]
])
```
